## Description

Accessibility HTML is an edited version of Horieson's homepage that opens up the site to a wider userbase. The updated version fixes a few small bugs, and improves on the previous version's code base by replacing vague `<div>` tags with semantic tags (e.g. `<main>` `<section>` `<aside>`) that allow for accessibility. Alt attributes were added to images, as well, providing a rich, meaningful experience for users that require text readers or users with low bandwidth. The HTML was also restructured to mirror the flow of the live site, and class and id names were clarified, consolidated, or removed in order to simplify the syntax and follow more closely with the semantic HTML. CSS was updated to match changes to HTML and was condensed to avoid repitition and superfluous code, making for simpler syntax and increased clarity. Finally, comments were added to HTML to provide more detail and clarity regarding the structure of the webpage.
